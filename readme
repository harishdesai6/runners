### What Are Self-Hosted Runners in GitHub Actions?

Self-hosted runners are machines (like your laptop, a server, or a cloud VM) that you provide and manage, and that can execute GitHub Actions workflows instead of using GitHubâ€™s default hosted runners.They allow you to run CI/CD jobs on your own infrastructure, giving you more control over the environment, performance, security, and cost.
